Vatican, is a web application that stores immunization records and uses data analytics to suggest vaccinations that need to be taken based on location. Powered by the Blockchain and supervised Deep Learning techniques we provide a sophisticated ledger of vaccination data. This data helps patients keep track of their immunizations so that they can remain healthy. Additionally, healthcare providers gain access to their patient's vacciantion data making it easier to get them the vaccinations they need.
